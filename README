    This is a microgrid modelling code, which can be used to assess the economic and environmental impacts of
    integrating renewable energy and energy storage assets into an otherwise isolated microgrid (presumably
    reliant on diesel, or other fuel-based, generation to begin with).


    The makefile and all source code was successfully tested on the following OS and architectures:

        Operating System: Linux Mint 20.2
                  Kernel: Linux 5.4.0-162-generic
            Architecture: x86-64
        
        Operating System: Linux Mint 21.2
                  Kernel: Linux 6.5.4-76060504-generic
            Architecture: x86-64

        Operating System: Windows 11 Home
                 Version: 10.0.22621 Build 22621
            Architecture: 64-bit OS, x64-based processor


    The following compilers were used in testing:

        g++ (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.2) 9.4.0
        g++ (Ubuntu 11.4.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.4.0
        g++ (Rev10, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.2.0


    PGMcpp has the following dependencies (by compiler link):

        -lpthread
